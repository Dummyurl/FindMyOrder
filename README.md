# FindMyOrder

The main purpose of this project is to monitor the couriers in real time on the map, and in this way to follow the packages that must be delivered by them. Besides this, there is the possibility to view a set of minimum statistics for every daily ride of each courier.

The practical side of the software solution is mainly composed of two mobile applications for Android platform. One of these, is specially realized for the courier, while the other one is created for the client. This distribution in two distinct applications was necessary because of the different implemented functionalities for the needs of each of the two types of users.

Another component of the application is an web site that is representing the administrator side of the project, from which the information stored in the database can be modified or viewed.
